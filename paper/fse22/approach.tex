This section presents our architecture of \Model for generating input
sentences. The high level of \Model is illustrated in
\ref{fig:OverallModel}. \Model first searches seed sentences that
meets each requirement for a linguistic capability. The seed sentences
are parsed into their \cfg. Meanwhile, \Model builds the reference
\pcfg from a large natural language corpus. Each \cfg of seed
sentences are
