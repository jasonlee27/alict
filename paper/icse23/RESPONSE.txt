>Differences with prior grammar-based work (e.g., MT-NLP, Astraea,
 Ogma etc)

Our method is a grammar-based behavioral testing method for over
linguistic capabilities(LCs) while the existing work (Ogma, Astraea and
MT-NLP) focus on testing fairness and erroneous inputs.  Second, our
method keeps label consistency while prior work doesn't garauntee the
label consistency as they only focus on input generation. Third, ours
generates input with new structure while others relies on the
original structure and replaces words based on their manually
generated grammar. Additionally, the existing work randomly selects
words, but our work selects grammatically and contextually natural
words suggested from CFG grammar and word suggestion model.

>Introducing the linguistic capability...the loop framework.

Our work uses the same linguistic capabilities introduced in
CEHCKLIST.

>Effort involved in specifying the rules?

LCs in CHECKLIST are ambiguously described in a sentence. Thus, we
manually extract elements of interests for each LCs in CHECKLIST. In
practice, we spent less than 10 min to generate each LC.
