Thank you for the comments.

>Differences with prior grammar-based work (e.g., MT-NLP, Astraea,
 Ogma etc)

Our method is a grammar-based behavioral testing method for over
linguistic capabilities(LCs) while the existing work (Ogma, Astraea
and MT-NLP) focus on testing fairness and erroneous inputs.  Second,
our method keeps label consistency while prior work doesn't garauntee
the label consistency as they only focus on input generation. Third,
ours generates input with new structure while others relies on the
original structure and replaces words based on their manually
generated grammar. Additionally, the existing work randomly selects
words, but our work selects grammatically and contextually natural
words suggested from CFG grammar and word suggestion model.

>Introducing the linguistic capability...the loop framework.

Our work uses the same LCs provided in CEHCKLIST.

>Effort involved in specifying the rules?

LCs in CHECKLIST are ambiguously described in a sentence. Thus, we
manually extract elements of interests for each LCs in CHECKLIST. In
practice, we spent less than 10 min to generate each LC.

>Do not see a clear motivation of using linguistic capabilities.

Our work uses the same LCs provided in CEHCKLIST. They describes
specific metamorphic relations between linguistic patten in input and
output. It enables behavior testing and finding erroneous patterns of
models.

>Generalizability of the proposed method seems limited.

S^2LCT is also implemented for hate speech detection task.  We will
add results of the task in our final version [JL] or appendix?.

>Comparison of S^2LCT with NLP adversarial machine learning.

S^2LCT evaluate model behavior under task-relevant LCs. It generates
test cases suitable to evalaute model given LC rather error-causing
test cases.

>No discussion or results about repair strategy.

>Fail Rate for CHECKLIST

[JL] do we add the numbers here or say that we will add that in the
appendix? or final version?

>Production rule coverage.: We
[JL] Do we answer the question?

>label consistency results for CHECKLIST

[JL] do we add the numbers here or say that we will add that in the appendix?
