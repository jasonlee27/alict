>>>>> REQUIREMENT: Sentiment change over time, present should prevail
	SEED 0: Previously, I used to like it saying that "... Wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie, balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving War Department telegrams.", although now I don't like it.
	SEED 1: Last time, I agreed with saying that "What could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever, charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters.", but now I hate it.
	SEED 2: I liked it much as to say that "The best revenge may just be living well because this film, unlike other Dumas adaptations, is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence.", but now I hate it.
	SEED 3: I hated it much as to say that "With a " Spy Kids " sequel opening next week, why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " SNL " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni?", although now I like it.
	SEED 4: I liked it much as to say that "A breathtaking adventure for all ages, Spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images.", on the other hand now I hate it.

	SEED 3: This is not no " Waterboy! "
	SEED 4: This is not a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.
<<<<< REQUIREMENT: Negated negative should be positive or neutral
>>>>> REQUIREMENT: Negated neutral should still be neutral
	SEED 0: This is not amusing for about three minutes.
	SEED 1: This is not the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong's John Woo.

>>>>> REQUIREMENT: Negation of negative at the end, should be positive or neutral
	SEED 0: I thought that "Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery.", but I didn't
	SEED 1: I thought that "It delivers some chills and sustained unease, but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning.", but I didn't
	SEED 2: I thought that "Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns, creating a meandering, inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film.", but it wasn't

	SEED 2: I don't agree with, given The main problem being that it's only a peek., It's funny.
	SEED 3: I wouldn't say, given The main problem being that it's only a peek., An inventive, absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist.
	SEED 4: I don't agree with, given If you're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly, watch Snatch again., It's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again.
