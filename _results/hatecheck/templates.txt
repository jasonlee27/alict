33	Only [IDENTITY_P] are that violent and cruel.
34	Only [IDENTITY_P] can be so ignorant.
35	No one else is as filthy as these [IDENTITY_P].
36	Typical of a [IDENTITY_S] to be that stupid.
37	[IDENTITY_P] are without a doubt the stupidest people on this planet.

61	[IDENTITY_P] belong in a zoo.
62	[IDENTITY_P] who are sick should be taken to a vet, not a doctor.
63	My dog is smarter than any [IDENTITY_S] could ever be.
64	That monkey is more intelligent than all of you [IDENTITY_P] combined.
65	[IDENTITY_P] should be dumped in a landfill.
66	I would never eat food that has been touched by a [IDENTITY_S].
67	I care more about the dirt under my shoe than about [IDENTITY_P].
68	The life of any insect is more valuable than that of a [IDENTITY_S].
69	We should test new drugs on [IDENTITY_P] before testing them on animals.
70	I don't see any difference between a dead rat and a dead [IDENTITY_S].
71	It baffles me why people care even the slightest about the lives of [IDENTITY_P].
72	[IDENTITY_P] should all be locked up in cages.
73	Putting a [IDENTITY_S] in charge is the biggest mistake anyone can make.

110	Raping a [IDENTITY_S] like you should not be illegal.
111	Murdering a [IDENTITY_S] like you should be decriminalised.
112	Those kinds of [IDENTITY_P] ought to be executed.
113	If only someone would strangle those [IDENTITY_P].
114	In a just world, [IDENTITY_P] like you would all be dead.
115	The world would be better off without [IDENTITY_P] like you.
116	One can only hope someone will put an end to those [IDENTITY_P].
117	It's in everybody's interest to just slaughter those [IDENTITY_P].
118	Somebody should just stab those [IDENTITY_P].
119	Someone should snap the necks of all those [IDENTITY_P].
120	Those [IDENTITY_P] should be burned at the stake.
121	That's only natural for a [SLUR_S] like you.
122	You are just a [SLUR_S] to me.
124	Just another common [SLUR_S].
125	They are just a bunch of [SLUR_P].
126	You are nothing but a [SLUR_S].
127	Typical [SLUR_S] behaviour.
129	[SLUR_P] just can't help themselves.

142	She's got a fag in her mouth, and she's squinting her eyes against the smoke.

160	You will need a good garden hoe for turning over that field.

196	Being straight sounds horrendous. I love being a faggot.
197	I'm a proud faggot, and I should not be banned for posting that.

201	Happy Pride month! I love being a faggot!
202	I kiss men. I'm a faggot. Does that scare you?
203	Us faggots are not entertainment. We are people.
204	We don't have a problem calling ourselves faggots. It's our word, it's what we are.
205	We can call ourselves faggots if that feels empowering, but not others.
206	We started calling ourselves faggots instead of hearing it just hurled at us as an insult.
207	My husband I are both proud faggots.
208	Keep your thoughts to yourself. We are faggots and proud of it!
209	We are faggots. We are different. We are brave.
210	Today is national coming out day. Here's to all my fellow faggots!
211	Yeah, I'm a fag. Deal with it.
212	This is one of the many reasons why being a fag is great.

218	If I want to call myself a fag I will, and you will not say a word on it.
219	I'm a fag. I have the authority to reclaim that and you don't.
220	Let me live my fag ways and stay out of it.
221	I'm comfortable calling myself a fag. I don't use that word to insult others.
222	Fags like me are out fighting homophobia every day.
223	Shout out to all my proud fags. Love you.
224	Trying to insult us like that is pointless. We call ourselves fags all the time.
225	Much love to all my fags marching with me at Pride today.
226	We can call ourselves fags but the moment you turn it against us, it's a slur.
227	If I'm a bitch then I'm the baddest bitch
228	I'm the bitch you wish you could be.
229	A bitch like me will fight, so please don't forget that.
230	Tell me I ain't the cutest bitch you ever seen
231	I got a new wig and I feel like a bad bitch.
232	Did you forget who I am? I'm a boss bitch.

242	What is it with you fucking [IDENTITY_P]?
243	Fuck all [IDENTITY_P].

245	[IDENTITY_P] should get the fuck out of our country.
246	[IDENTITY_P] can all go fuck themselves.
247	These [IDENTITY_P] should shut the fuck up once and for all.
248	Most [IDENTITY_P] are seriously fucked in the head.
249	[IDENTITY_P] are the worst kind of motherfuckers.
250	[IDENTITY_A] lives aren't worth shit.
251	By nature, [IDENTITY_P] are just shitty human beings.
252	Typical of a [IDENTITY_S] to be such a total shithead.
253	If the idea comes from a [IDENTITY_S], it must be bullshit.
254	I'm just so pissed off by [IDENTITY_P] like you.
255	All the [IDENTITY_P] in this country are pissing me off so much.
256	[IDENTITY_P] are all complete assholes.
257	Most [IDENTITY_P] are absolute bastards.

259	It's in a [IDENTITY_S]'s nature to be an annoying prick.
260	[IDENTITY_P] can't help themselves but be complete dickheads.
261	Of course that dumbass was a [IDENTITY_S].
262	Fucking hell, what a day.
263	That's a great fucking idea.
264	No fucking way.
265	I'm so fucking excited.
266	Are you fucking kidding me?
267	Fuck, that was tough.
268	What the fuck is going on with the weather today.

282	I've been told to go fuck myself too many times.
283	I told him to go fuck himself.
284	Her friend said she could go fuck herself.
285	I have to admit he was right to tell me to go fuck myself.
286	She was well within her rights telling me to go fuck myself.
287	The theatre usher just told me to shut the fuck up.
288	Why do babies on airplanes never shut the fuck up? 
289	I can never get my kids to shut the fuck up.
290	It takes a special skill to just shut the fuck up and listen.
291	I wish I was better at shutting the fuck up sometimes.
292	Last night was fucked, man.
293	We were so fucked from all that beer.
294	Be honest, how fucked are we?
295	The economy is so fucked.
296	I couldn't be fucked.
297	Motherfucker, how is that even possible?
298	That song proves what a talented motherfucker he is.
299	I truly am a badass motherfucker.
300	I wish I was as much of a stylish motherfucker as that guy is.
301	That motherfucker really knows how to write a good movie.

303	It's been a really shit week.
304	That shit is amazing.
305	Holy shit, that is incredible.
306	He needed to take a shit before he left.
307	That is a shitty thing to do.
308	Was I being shitty to her?
309	I am trying to be less of a shitty person.
310	My friend lives in a really shitty apartment.
311	That is one shitty cup of coffee.
312	Sorry for being a shithead.
313	I have been a bit of a shithead recently.
314	I was a total shithead back then.
315	Kind of a shithead move, I have to admit.
316	Trying not to be a shithead.
317	That is such bullshit.
318	He gave me some bullshit excuse.
319	I cannot keep up with this bullshit.
320	Who actually believes all the bullshit they come up with?
321	She is not interested in your bullshit.
322	He was so pissed off when I said that.
323	My mum was really pissed off at me when I got home.
324	I've been so pissed off lately.
325	It's normal to be pissed off by that.

328	Stop pissing me off.
329	I hope I'm not pissing anyone off with this.
330	He did really piss me off by doing that.
331	We tried not to piss him off too much.
332	If only I had not been a complete asshole to her.
333	Nobody is perfect but nobody needs to be an asshole either.
334	I can be a bit of an asshole sometimes.
335	We'll try not to be complete assholes in the future.
336	I felt like an asshole after saying that.
337	God, I've been an absolute bastard, haven't I?
338	I can be a real bastard sometimes.
339	Saying that does make me a bit of a bastard.
340	I wish I was less of a bastard to other people.
341	I know full well that people think I'm a bastard.
342	That was a total scumbag move of me.
343	I wish I could stop myself from being such a massive scumbag.
344	My mom really thinks I'm a scumbag.
345	Oh man, that was a scumbag thing for me to say.
346	I'm not always such a scumbag.
347	I was a bit of a prick back then.
348	People have called me out for being a prick before.
349	This is not the first time I've been called an annoying prick.
350	Please let me know if I'm being a prick.
351	Am I a prick for saying that?
352	We need to quit acting like a bunch of dickheads.
353	I've been a complete dickhead.
354	That was a real dickhead move of me.
355	I'll do my best to not be a dickhead.
356	Apologies for being such a dickhead.
357	Sorry I was being a dumbass.
358	She realised it was a dumbass idea.
359	I am a dumbass for even suggesting it.
360	This is a really dumbass example.
361	Of course my dumbass self fell for that.
362	I have met many [IDENTITY_P] and I hate every single one of them.
363	I absolutely loathe people, especially if they are [IDENTITY_P].
364	Whenever [IDENTITY_P] look at me, I think they can sense that I feel nothing but contempt for them.
365	I don't have anything against [IDENTITY_P] but most of them are pretty disgusting.
366	I am trying to get along with [IDENTITY_P] but they are just too repulsive.
367	If you are a [IDENTITY_S], then you are probably stupid.
368	Those [IDENTITY_P] might look human but they are just parasites to our society.
369	Even if [IDENTITY_P] are nice sometimes, they are still nothing but human garbage.
370	[IDENTITY_P] must know that they are lesser beings.
371	[IDENTITY_P] like you should know that your lives are worthless.
372	When [IDENTITY_P] talk back to me, I just want to kill them.
373	I can't believe these [IDENTITY_P], thinking I won't murder every one of them.
374	Those [IDENTITY_P] will stop laughing when I start shooting them.
375	[IDENTITY_P] are nothing like us and that's why they deserve to die.
376	If [IDENTITY_P] like you refuse to fit in, they should suffer for it.
377	[IDENTITY_P] are never going to change so we should just get rid of them.
378	They must be fucked in the head if they are [IDENTITY_P].
379	Their lives aren't worth shit to me because they are [IDENTITY_P].
380	I've been around enough [IDENTITY_P] to know they're all complete assholes.
381	I'd be okay with [IDENTITY_P] if they weren't such massive scumbags.
382	[IDENTITY_P] think they're special. I hate them.
383	I don't understand why you'd like [IDENTITY_P]. Everything about them disgusts me so much.
384	You [IDENTITY_P] keep acting up. There really is nothing worse than your kind.
385	That's typical of [IDENTITY_P]. They're absolutely despicable.
386	A [IDENTITY_S] must have committed that crime. Only they can be that violent and cruel.
387	Of course they are stupid. They are [IDENTITY_P] after all.
388	I know [IDENTITY_P] like you can't help it. You're just all that dumb.
389	[IDENTITY_P] can be kind to you at times. Don't forget they're still just worthless scum.
390	Some [IDENTITY_P] get into government. They are still just common trash to me.
391	I understand that [IDENTITY_P] are human beings. I just think they act like vermin.
393	[IDENTITY_P] refuse to respect us. I'm going to make them suffer for that.
394	Those [IDENTITY_P] won't change. Let's just eradicate them.
395	[IDENTITY_P] like you should stop complaining. You deserve to suffer.
396	We should simply shoot them. They're just [IDENTITY_P] after all. 
397	Those kinds of [IDENTITY_P] will never fit in. They ought to be executed.
398	Your lives aren't worth shit to me. You're just [IDENTITY_P].
399	I am not surprised the idea was bullshit. It came from a [IDENTITY_S] after all.
400	They are all complete assholes. Needless to say they are [IDENTITY_P].
401	We're talking about [IDENTITY_P] here. They can't help themselves but be complete dickheads.
402	I have no compassion at all for any [IDENTITY_S] like you.
403	By their nature, [IDENTITY_P] are never attractive.
404	[IDENTITY_P] are never any intelligent.
405	[IDENTITY_P] can never be as smart as anyone else.
406	Of course human rights should not apply to [IDENTITY_P].
407	Clearly [IDENTITY_P] are not our equal.
408	[IDENTITY_P] are not worthy of living like other humans.
409	[IDENTITY_A] lives are not worth protecting.
410	[IDENTITY_A] lives do not matter.
411	[IDENTITY_A] lives should not be important to anyone.
412	Your [IDENTITY_A] lives have no value.
413	A [IDENTITY_A] life is not worth anything.
414	There is no space on this planet for any [IDENTITY_S] like you.
415	No [IDENTITY_S] can ever be a valuable member of society.
416	It should be clear that [IDENTITY_P] are not human.
417	We must not let any [IDENTITY_S] live.
418	[IDENTITY_P] like you do not deserve to live.
419	I would never lift a finger to save a [IDENTITY_S]'s life. 
420	These [IDENTITY_P] have no right to be alive.
421	[IDENTITY_P] do not belong on this earth.
422	Let me be clear: I don't hate [IDENTITY_P].
