DATA::PASS::0.0 0.0 1.0::2::2::Some people think that " Godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ...

DATA::PASS::0.9 0.0 0.1::0::0::Some people think that " Katz uses archival footage, horrifying documents of lynchings, still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history, but most powerful of all is the song itself ", but I think that " The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . "
DATA::PASS::0.0 0.0 1.0::2::2::You agree with that " Without September 11, Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie . ", but I think that " Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace's maternal fury, her fearlessness, and because of that, his film crackles . "
DATA::PASS::0.0 0.0 1.0::2::2::Many people agree with that " Without September 11, Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie . ", but I think that " Lee Jeong-Hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that I couldn't help being captivated by it . "

DATA::PASS::1.0 0.0 0.0::0::0::Many people agree with that " Though the film is well-intentioned, one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .

"
DATA::PASS::0.1 0.0 0.9::2::2::You agree with that " Without September 11, Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie . ", but I think that " For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope, there's something creepy about this movie . "
DATA::PASS::0.0 0.0 1.0::2::2::You agree with that " Weird . ", but I think that " (Leigh) has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors (improvised over many months) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . "
DATA::PASS::1.0 0.0 0.0::0::0::You agree with that " Overall, it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love .

DATA::PASS::0.7 0.0 0.3::0::0::Many people agree with that " Overall, it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love . ", but I think that " I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . "
DATA::PASS::0.8 0.0 0.2::0::0::They think that " Overall, it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love . ", but I think that " While Scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " Gangs " is never lethargic, the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . "
DATA::PASS::0.9 0.0 0.1::0::0::You agree with that " Katz uses archival footage, horrifying documents of lynchings, still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history, but most powerful of all is the song itself ", but I think that " A chilly, remote, emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be: ` In space, no one can hear you snore .'

DATA::PASS::1.0 0.0 0.0::0::0::Some people think that " Katz uses archival footage, horrifying documents of lynchings, still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history, but most powerful of all is the song itself ", but I think that " Downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " PG-13 rating . "
