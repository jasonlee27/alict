- rewrite results after having all results.

- rewrite approach based on feedback

Hasattr(feature, value)
Hasattr vd contain(tag_of_pos)

sec3.1 
Type of predicates 
hasattr checks attributes
contain – need external domain knowledge based.

Template – explain prefix, suffix so on.
Token clause


Placeholder- 1. Enumerative, 2. Search based
2. by defining functions (hasattr, contain)
1. (template)


Test results:
-	Figure 4 & 5 get values using just expansion sentences.
-	Selfbleu score on checklist+exp and hatecheck+exp
-	Manual test: measure how much expanded sentences are meaningless from seed sentence

Check the availability in review (adv approaches)


=====

+ generate new sample test cases for human study:
  approved by rav(sa), zihe(sa), miao(hs), saif(hs) and need to wait
  for their results
  2 is fine but with more test cases    
  Ask measure time for spending

+ ask simin for neral coverage for new validated test cases: need to
  wait for his results

+ run the selfbleu and pdr coverage for the new validated test cases:
  not done for hs

+ make table for test results

+ rewrite experiment

+ make a table of pdr coverage comparing hatecheck and hatecheck+its
  expansion: it is running for the expansion
  
+ rewrite the approach section

+ rewrite the intro section based on comments

+ Remove LC1-6 in hatecheck

+ make a table of pdr coverage comparing checklist and checklist+its
  expansion 

+ Figure out how to characterize LC specs using predicates for LCs
for seeds: did for searching and keep the transformation templates in
the table.

+ Validation of LC after expansion: done and experiments for obtaining
test results for sa is running. Test results for hs is done and in the
table 3 in overleaf.

+ Only the free form can be expanded (e.g. LC3: static form used for
transform template cannot be expanded)
