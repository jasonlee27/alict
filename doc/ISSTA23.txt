We decided to submit to ISSTA 2023

TODO:

- rewrite the approach section

- rewrite experiment

- rewrite results after having all results

- ask simin for neral coverage for new validated test cases:
  decide to meet after his FSE submission

- generate new sample test cases for human study

- make table for test results: done for hs, but not done for sa

- run the selfbleu and pdr coverage for the new validated test cases:
  running for hs, not done for sa

=====

+ rewrite the intro section based on comments

+ Remove LC1-6 in hatecheck

+ Figure out how to characterize LC specs using predicates for LCs
for seeds: did for searching and keep the transformation templates in
the table.

+ Validation of LC after expansion: done and experiments for obtaining
test results for sa is running. Test results for hs is done and in the
table 3 in overleaf.

+ Only the free form can be expanded (e.g. LC3: static form used for
transform template cannot be expanded)
