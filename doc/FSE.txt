Result:

Test-result-all-table:
1. 6 out of 10 lcs of sa task obtain significantly more number of test
cases generated and fail cases.
for lc1 and 2, we search test cases with its length less than 10
words. In addition, lc4 and 5 finds test cases starting with
demonstratives words. Therefore, sst dataset contains relatively small
number of test cases that meets such constraints.

3. In addition, using syntax expansion process introduces many pass to
fail cases. It finds what input features fool the model and useful to
analyze model with those test cases.

Test-hs-result-table:
1. 18 out of 19 lcs of hs task obtain significantly more number of
test cases generated. 1 lc in the hs task requires sentences without
any positive and negative words with group identifiers. hatexplain
dataset contains relatively small number of test cases that meets such
constraints
2. all lcs of hs task obtain significantly more number of failed test
cases generated.
3. In addition, using syntax expansion process introduces many pass to
fail cases. It finds what input features fool the model and useful to
analyze model with those test cases.
